SCSE EVENT PORTAL

The creation of the SCSE Events Portal has provided a structured and digitalized platform for managing events within the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE). By integrating HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the portal ensures an interactive and dynamic user experience. The platform consists of an Admin Panel, where administrators can add events, and a Participants Panel, where students can view club profiles, access the notice board, check upcoming events, and register for them.
With HTML and CSS, we have designed a visually appealing and responsive interface, ensuring smooth navigation. JavaScript adds interactivity to enhance user engagement, while PHP and MySQL manage the backend functionalities, including user authentication, database operations, and content management. Additionally, XAMPP and Notepad++ were used for local development and testing, providing an efficient working environment.
