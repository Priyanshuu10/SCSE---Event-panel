SCSE EVENT PORTAL

The creation of the SCSE Events Portal has introduced a streamlined and digitized system for event management within the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE). Built using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the portal offers a dynamic and user-friendly experience. It features an Admin Panel for club administrators to add and manage events, and a Participant Panel where students can explore club profiles, view notices, check upcoming events, and register for them. The frontend, crafted with HTML and CSS, delivers a responsive and visually engaging interface, while JavaScript enhances interactivity for better user engagement. On the backend, PHP and MySQL handle critical functions such as user authentication, data management, and content operations. For local development and testing, XAMPP and Visual Studio Code were employed, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.
